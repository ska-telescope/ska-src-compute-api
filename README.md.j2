# SKA SRC {{ api_name_hyphenated_and_capitalised }} API

This API is a templated SRCNet API. Please fill out this section with details about what the API does.

[TOC]

## Getting started

A script has been provided to initialise this template. This initialisation performs only the necessary steps for
local, **unauthenticated** development; by default the docker-compose enviromment does not connect the API with the
Authentication or Permissions APIs (see Development -> Bypassing AuthN/Z). **This means all endpoints are publicly 
accessible**.

To initialise a template, you must first choose a suitable API name. This name should be lowercase with words separated
by hyphens, e.g.

```bash
eng@ubuntu:~/SKAO/ska-src-template-api$ make init API_NAME=some-name
```

Good API names are short (but not to the detriment of understanding what they do!) and self-describing. Acronyms should
be avoided.

You should then follow the standard steps for deployment via docker-compose, discussed in the Deployment section.

When the service has been deployed, navigate to http://localhost:8080/v1/www/docs/oper to view the frontend.

## Authentication

The following sections assume that the API has been integrated with both IAM and the Permissions API. This involves:

- Creating an IAM client (for Services to obtain access via a `client_credentials` grant),
- Passing the credentials (id/secret) to either `.env` files (docker-compose) or in the `values.yaml` (helm), and
- Creating the permissions policy and loading it in to the Permissions API.

Access can then be granted for either a User or Service.

### User

To access this API as a user, the user needs to have first authenticated with the SRCNet and to have exchanged the token 
resulting from this initial authentication with one that allows access to this specific service. See the Authentication 
Mechanism and Token Exchange Mechanism sections of the Authentication API for more specifics.

### Service

For service-to-service interactions, it is possible to obtain a token via a ***client_credentials*** grant to the
{{ iam_client_name }} IAM client.

## Authorisation

Hereafter, the caller (either a user or another service) is assumed to have a valid token allowing access to this API. 
Authenticated requests are then made by including this token in the header.

The token audience must also match the expected audience, also defined in the {{ permissions_service_name }} permissions 
policy (default: “{{ permissions_service_name }}”).

### Restricting user access to routes using token scopes

The presented token must include a specific scope expected by the service to be permitted access to all API routes. This 
scope is defined in the {{ permissions_service_name }} permissions policy 
(default: “{{ permissions_service_name }}-service”). 

**This scope must also be added to the IAM permissions client otherwise the process of token instrospection will drop 
this scope.**

## Development

Makefile targets have been included to facilitate easier and more consistent development against this API. The general 
recipe is as follows:

1. Depending on the fix type, create a new major/minor/patch branch, e.g. 
    ```bash
    $ make patch-branch NAME=some-name
    ```
    Note that this both creates and checkouts the branch.
2. Make your changes.
3. Create new code samples if necessary.
   ```bash
   $ make code-samples
   ```
4. Add your changes to the branch:
    ```bash
   $ git add ...
    ```
5. Either commit the changes manually (if no version increment is needed) or bump the version and commit, entering a 
   commit message when prompted:
    ```bash
   $ make bump-and-commit
    ```
6. Push the changes upstream when ready:
    ```bash
   $ make push
    ```

Note that the CI pipeline will fail if python packages with the same semantic version are committed to the GitLab 
Package Registry.

### Bypassing AuthN/Z

AuthN/Z can be bypassed for development by setting `DISABLE_AUTHENTICATION=yes` in the environment.

## Deployment

Deployment is managed by docker-compose or helm.

The docker-compose file can be used to bring up the necessary services locally i.e. the REST API, setting the mandatory
environment variables. Sensitive environment variables, including those relating to the IAM client, should be kept in
`.env` files to avoid committing them to the repository.

There is also a helm chart for deployment onto a k8s cluster.

### Example via docker-compose

Edit the `.env.template` file accordingly and rename to `.env`, then:

```bash
eng@ubuntu:~/SKAO/{{ python_package_name }}$ docker-compose up
```

### Example via Helm

After editing the `values.yaml` (template in `/etc/helm/`):

```bash
$ create namespace {{ python_package_name }}
$ helm install --namespace {{ python_package_name }} {{ python_package_name }} .
```
